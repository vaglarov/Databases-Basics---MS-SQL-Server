--PROBLEM 11
--Mr. Bodrog is highly interested in profitability. He wants to know the average interest of all deposit groups
-- split by whether the deposit has expired or not. 
--But that’s not all. He wants you to select deposits with start date after 01/01/1985. 
--Order the data descending by Deposit Group and ascending by Expiration Flag.
